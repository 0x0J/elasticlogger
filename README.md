Elasticlogger is a wrapper for oliveres elastic package

The goal of this package is to enable elasticlogger as an part of the io.writer interface.

Why io.Writer? Because then we can use elasticsearch for a TON of other features, for example logging.

It is very easy to use, simply start by creating your elasticlogger
var elasticlogger, _ = elastic.NewElasticLogger($ip, $port, $system)

System variable is the actual index that will be used. Index will be appended with the date or any other flags added
to the stdlib logger.

It is recommended to add date to the Index via flags, since Elasticsearch does not handle 
static indexes very well. A common bug is that upon restarting the cluster, it wont accept updates to an index since it goes into lock state. Adding the date to the index will prevent this, since updates will be on new indexes.

Take your elasticlogger and put it into any io.Writer of your choice. Below is an example of stdlib logger:

var flags = log.Ldate | log.Lshortfile
var logger = log.New(elasticlogger, "main.go", flags)
logger.Println("erhmagerd")
